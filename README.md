# Work_Life_Balance_Indicator
UX design project for my UI/UX design class at Sogang in Seoul, Korea.
We had to design a product for a problem of our choice.
For the project, the teacher wanted us to stray away from web and mobile apps and design a solution that would use various user interactions to solve a problem in a creative new way.
We were asked to be as creative as possible even if it meant designing products that may be unfeasible.

We had an assumption which was that people had a hard time getting a good work-life balance. 
Another assumption we had that came from our previous UX design project is that whenever people have an indicator to inform them of how they are doing compared to their goals, they tend to stick to their goals better.

To test these assumptions, we performed a survey among a total of 48 white collar students and professionals of various fields through a google form.
With this form we wanted as many answers as possible so we used yes or no questions or questions where users rate between 1 to 5.
We asked various questions that aimed to check if work-life balance is indeed something people struggle with, and to find out what they current and desired work-life balance is on a scale of 1 to 5 going from all work to all life (play). We also asked whether they would be interested in a product serving as an indicator.

The results :

From there we interviewed some more professionals with more specific mostly open-ended questions to have more detail on why people struggle with work-life balance and which form of product they would prefer :
We got from these interviews that users preferred a product that had both a physical component (like a bracelet) and a mobile app to check their data in more detail.

Preferred form of product using user input.

The product could look like the following :
A bracelet that has leds to indicate the current work-life balance, can vibrate and release a relaxing scent.

Paired with a mobile app that contains the user's data :
